This is a second-year software engineering project in C that parses three CSV files containing information about drivers, passengers, and trips, respectively. The project goal is to create an efficient data storage and querying system that manages memory usage while generating statistics and answering questions about the ride-sharing platform. The code is designed with encapsulation principles in mind, making it easier to modify and extend the codebase while maintaining its integrity. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive example of memory management, query optimization, and encapsulation principles in practice. In addition, we also have implemented input validation and filtering mechanisms to handle and discard any invalid data, ensuring the integrity of the system.
